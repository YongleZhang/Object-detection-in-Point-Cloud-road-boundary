# Object-detection-in-Point-Cloud-road-boundary
Object detection in Point Cloud is popular in HD Map and sensor-based autonomous driving. There  basically four types of object you can obtain in daily scenario: road surface - contains painted lane  marking and pavement area, support facility - contains road boundary (guardrail and curb), road  sign, light pole, etc., uncorrelated object - for example, sidewalk, building, etc., and moving object -  such like pedestrian, vehicle, bicycle, etc.  In this project, please search references, design and prototype your road  boundary (guardrail) detection algorithm.
